Lyrics to 'Blue Gangsta', by Michael Jackson:

What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta
What you gonna do? 'Cause I'm gonna get you
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
All the things you said and the things you've done to me
You can no longer make me cry
Look what you done to me, baby
I can no longer smile, baby
And I've waited so long, just to carry on
I'm the blue gangsta
What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine (gangster)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (I'm the blue gangsta)
What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine
(I can never fall in love)
The blue gangsta
What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine (what you gonna do?)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine
(I can never fall in love)
The blue gangsta
You've tricked me nine to five, loving you is a crime
People telling me, you got another guy
I've been abused, watch me light the fuse
Said you'd be my wife, nothing but big lies
Don't know what I'd done, everything you got
Things you done to me, coming back to you
You know just what I've done, the things you done to me
I'm the blue gangsta
What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine (oh no)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (I'm the blue gangsta)
What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine
(I can never fall in love)
The blue gangsta
What you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)
You ain't no friend of mine (what you gonna do?)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
(Look what you put me through, girl)
What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine (oh no)
(I can never fall in love)
The blue gangsta
See, I am so amused to the things you said
And the things you done, done to me
There is nothing in this world that would make me change
You make me wanna sing
Nah, yeah
The blue gangsta
What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine (what you gonna do?)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (look what you put me through, baby)
What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine
(I'm never gonna fall in love)
The blue gangsta
What you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)
You ain't no friend of mine (what you gonna do?)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (look what you put me through, girl)
What you gonna do? (Oh no)
You ain't no friend of mine
(I'm never gonna fall in love)
The blue gangsta
What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine (you ain't no friend of mine)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (you ain't no friend of mine)
What you gonna do? (Oh no)
You ain't no friend of mine
(I'm never fall in love)
The blue gangsta
What you gonna do? (what you gonna do?)
You ain't no friend of mine (said, look what you put me through)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta
What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine (oh no)
The blue gangsta
